### Hi, I'm Blake Anthony 👋

- 🐍 I've been coding in Python for over 10 years.
- 🚂 I'm the founder of Purdue's [NanoML team](https://nanoml.org/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ml-devops and front-end.
- 📫 How to reach me: wilso692@purdue.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've moved close to 30 times in my life.

I'm an ECE Ph.D Candidate at Purdue University making the most of Python for simulating neutral atom systems, CUDA-accelerated optimization, and developing machine learning models.
I'm currently looking for a computational scientist or research engineer position working on software for physics and ML driven companies. I'd especially enjoy working at a startup where software moves fast and I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
